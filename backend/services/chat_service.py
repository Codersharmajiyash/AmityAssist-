Conversation state-machine (FSM) service.

States:
  ASK_REASON  → Prompt student for withdrawal reason
  SUGGEST     → Classify intent, offer alternatives
  CONFIRM     → Request explicit CONFIRM / CANCEL
  DONE        → Withdrawal submitted; session closed
  RESOLVED    → Student chose an alternative; session closed gracefully

Session state is stored in-process (dict). The persistent record of every
